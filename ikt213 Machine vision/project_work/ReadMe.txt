My machine vision project was a hand gesture detection solution. We built two solution over the course of the project,
my job was to label our dataset, build the mediapipe solution and YOLOv4 solution. Mediapipe is a landmark digit based
solution which allows for simple expansion but can be difficult to expand into complex or multiple gestures. The Yolo
model was very successful but requires retraining for every new gesture (which includes a well developed dataset as well).
